Title: Natural Language Decomposition and Interpretation of Complex Utterances
Author: Jacob Andreas
Publish Year: 15 May 2023

Summary of paper

Motivation

natural language interface often require supervised data to translate user request into structure intent representations
however, during data collection, it can be difficult to anticipate and formalise the full range of user needs
we introduce an approach for equipping a simple language to code model to handle complex utterances via a process of hierarchical natural language decomposition.

Contribution

Experiments show that the proposed approach enables the interpretation of complex utterances with almost no complex training data, while outperforming standard few-shot prompting approaches.

Some key terms Methodology\nan approach called DECOMP, which decomposes complex utterances into a sequence of simpler natural language steps, each resembling an elementary utterance that an existing parser can handle, then uses this parser to map each elementary utterance to a sub-program. Good things about the paper (one paragraph) introduce new dataset that map utterances to programs : DeCU\nDeCU contains 872 elementary utterances paired with programs.\nExample prompt Top of the prompt is elementary utterances similar to the task Bottom of the prompt is the complex utterance decomposition examples the decomposition examples provide a demonstration of how to generate program fragments for a step conditioned on previous steps and help bridge any possible domain shift from elementary to complex utterances. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 Utterance : Find all meetings happening this week Program : val s1 = findEvents ( queryAt (` this `[ Interval [ Date ]] and isWeek )) \u003cEOS \u003e Utterance : How many days in the next week do I have meetings ?

<ul>
<li>natural language interface often require supervised data to translate user request into structure intent representations</li>
<li>however, during data collection, it can be difficult to anticipate and formalise the full range of user needs</li>
<li>we introduce an approach for equipping a simple language to code model to handle complex utterances via a process of hierarchical natural language decomposition.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contribution">Contribution<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" hidden="" href="#contribution">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Experiments show that the proposed approach enables the interpretation of complex utterances with almost no complex training data, while outperforming standard few-shot prompting approaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-key-terms">Some key terms<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" hidden="" href="#some-key-terms">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>an approach called DECOMP, which decomposes complex utterances into
a sequence of simpler natural language steps, each resembling an elementary utterance that an existing parser can handle, then uses this parser to map each elementary utterance to a sub-program.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>introduce new dataset that map utterances to programs : DeCU</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>DeCU contains 872 elementary utterances paired with programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-prompt">Example prompt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" hidden="" href="#example-prompt">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Top of the prompt is elementary utterances similar to the task</li>
<li>Bottom of the prompt is the complex utterance decomposition examples
<ul>
<li>the decomposition examples provide a demonstration of how to generate program fragments for a step conditioned on previous steps and help bridge any possible domain shift from elementary to complex utterances.</li>
