Our method clusters a corpus into sets of related documents, trains a separate expert language model on each cluster, and combines them in a sparse ensemble for inference.

Title: How Robust Is GPT 3.5 to Predecessors a Comprehensive Study on Language Understanding Tasks Author: Xuanting Chen et. al. Publish Year: 2023 Review Date: Mon, Apr 3, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2303/2303.00293.pdf Summary of paper Motivation GPT3.5, their robustness, and abilities to handle various complexities of the open world have yet to be explored, which is especially crucial in assessing the stability of models and is a key aspect of trustworthy AI Contribution Our study yielded the following findings by comparing GPT 3.5 with finetuned models competitive results on test sets: GPT3.5 achieves SOTA results in some NLU tasks compared to supervised models fine-tuned with task-specific data. In particular GPT-3.5 performs well in reading comprehension and sentiment analysis tasks, but face challenges in sequence tagging and relation extraction tasks. Lack of robustness: GPT-3.5 still encounter significant robustness degradation, such as its average performance dropping by up to 35.74% and 43.59% in natural language inference and sentiment analysis tasks, respectively. However, it is worth noting that GPT3.5 achieves remarkable robustness on certain tasks, such as reading comprehension and WSC tasks Robustness instability: In few-shot scenarios, GPT-3.5’s robustness improvement varies greatly across different tasks. For example, GPT-3.5 shows significant improvement in aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks while the robustness actually decreases in natural language inference (Section 4.3.1) and semantic matching (Section 4.3.2) tasks. Prompt sensitivity: changes in input prompts have a significant impact on the results, and GPT-3.5’s robustness to prompt variations. still requires improvement. Number sensitivity: GPT3.5 is more sensitive to numerical inputs than pre-training fine-tuning models. For example, in the NumWord transformation, which involves replacing numerical words in sentences with different numerical values, GPT3.5 exhibits a significantly high level of sensitivity. Task labels sensitivity: we speculate that the task construction during the instruction tuning stage may significantly impact the model’s performance. In the case of IMDB binary sentiment classification dataset, the model outputs a large number of “neutral” responses, which are not included in the application label space, resulting in a performance drop Significant improvement in zero/few-shot scenarios: in zero-shot and few-shot scenario, GPT3.5 outperforms existing LLMs in most NLU tasks, especially in reading comprehension, natural language inference and semantic matching tasks Ability for in-context learning: Compared to 0-shot, GPT 3.5 performs better on most tasks in the 1-shot setting. Additionally, performance does no vary significantly between the 1-shot, 3-shot, 6-shot, 9-shot settings for most tasks. However, providing additional examples in the prompts can be advantageous for sequence tagging tasks </p>

Title: Grounded Decoding Guiding Text Generation With Grounded Models for Robot Control Author: WenLong Huang et. al. Publish Year: 1 Mar, 2023 Review Date: Thu, Mar 30, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00855 Summary of paper Motivation Unfortunately, applying LLMs to settings with embodied agents, such as robots, is challenging due to their lack of experience with the physical world, inability to parse non-language observations, and ignorance of rewards or safety constraints that robots may require. on the other hand, language-conditioned robotic policies that learn from interaction data can provide the necessary grounding that allows the agent to be correctly situated in the real world, but such policies are limited by the lack of high-level semantic understanding due to the limited breadth of the interaction data available for training them. Contribution thus if we want to make use of the semantic knowledge in a language model while still situating it in an embodied setting, we must construct an action sequence that is both likely according to the language model and also realisable according to grounded models of the environment. we frame this as a problem similar to probabilistic filtering: decode a sequence that both has high probability under the language model and high probability under a set of grounded model objectives. Potential future work the work is related to using LMs info as a prior bias the problem framing is straightforward </p>

However, such a practice is inefficient for reinforcement learning because the eligible (high action value) responses are very sparse, and the greedy policy sustained by the random sampling is flabby. Contribution this paper shows that the performance of dialogue policy positively correlated with sampling size by theoretical and experimental. we introduce a novel dual-granularity Q-function to alleviate this limitation by exploring the most promising response category to intervene the sampling. Some key terms limitation of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective for the probability distribution of responses

Title: How to talk so AI will learn: Instructions, descriptions, and autonomy Author: Theodore R. Sumers et. al. Publish Year: NeurIPS 2022 Review Date: Wed, Mar 15, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07870.pdf Summary of paper Motivation yet today, we lack computational models explaining such language use Contribution To address this challenge, we formalise learning from language in a contextual bandit setting and ask how a human might communicate preferences over behaviours. (obtain intent (preference) from the presentation (behaviour)) we show that instructions are better in low-autonomy settings, but descriptions are better when the agent will need to act independently. We then define a pragmatic listener agent that robustly infers the speaker’s reward function by reasoning how the speaker expresses themselves. (language reward module?) we hope these insights facilitate a shift from developing agents that obey language to agents that learn from it. Some key terms two distinct types of language

Publish Year: 24 Feb 2023 Review Date: Fri, Mar 3, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12766.pdf Summary of paper Motivation recent work in visual representation learning for robotics demonstrates the viability of learning from large video datasets of humans performing everyday tasks. leveraging methods such as masked autoencoding and contrastive learning, these representations exhibit strong transfer to policy learning for visuomotor control but robot learning encompasses a diverse set of problems beyond control including grasp affordance prediction, language-conditioned imitation learning, and intent scoring for human-robot collaboration amongst others. Contribution first, we demonstrate that existing representations yield inconsistent results across these tasks: masked autoencoding approaches pick up on low-level spatial features at the cost of high-level semantics, while contrastive learning approaches capture the opposite (i.e., high-level semantics) We then introduce Voltron, a framework for language driven representation learning from human videos and associated captions. Voltron trades off language conditioned visual reconstruction to learn low-level visual patterns (mask auto-encoding) and visually grounded language generation to encode high-level semantics. (hindsight relabelling and contrastive learning) Some key terms How can we learn visual representations that generalise across the diverse spectrum of problems in robot learning?

Publish Year: 18 Feb 2023 Review Date: Fri, Mar 3, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09368.pdf Summary of paper Motivation previous approaches generally implemented language-conditioned RL by providing human instructions in natural language and training a following policy this is outside-in approach the policy needs to comprehend the NL and manage the task simultaneously. However, the unbounded NL examples often bring much extra complexity for solving concrete RL tasks, which can distract policy learning from completing the task Contribution we investigate an inside-out scheme for natural language-conditioned RL by developing a task language (TL) that is task-related and unique. The TL is used in RL to achieve high effective policy training. besides, a translator is trained to translate NL into TL. experiments indicate that the new model not only better comprehends NL instructions but also leads to better instruction following policy that improves 13.4% success rate and adapts to unseen expressions of NL instruction. </p>

To achieve this, we formulate instruction alignment problem in decision making. We propose Hindsight Instruction Relabeling (HIR), a novel algorithm for alignment language models with instructions.

Title: Benchmarks for Automated Commonsense Reasoning a Survey Author: Ernest Davis Publish Year: 9 Feb 2023 Review Date: Thu, Mar 2, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04752.pdf Summary of paper we mainly focus on the section where the author discusses about features of commonsense reasoning generally. Terms clarify what we mean by common sense
what is exactly “commonsensical”? Claims about common sense that seem true to the author Commonsense knowledge is common. In talking to other person, we do not have to explain common sense reasoning or enumerate common sense facts. We can assume that they know that unsupported things fall down, that outside the tropics, days in temperate regions are generally warmer than winter, and so on. Common sense is largely sensible. Any individual person or even an entire society may have various foolish or mistaken beliefs, but for the most part common sense knowledge correponds to the realities of the world as people experience it. Common sense supports reasoning. For example a person who knows that Central Park is in New York and the Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco and that New York and San Francisco are 3000 miles apart will realize that they cannot walk from one to the other in fifteen minutes. commonsense reasoning is integrated with other cognitive abilities Common sense extends across tasks and modalities Common sense is a broad scope Commonsense knowledge can be distinguished from common knowledge, encyclopaedic knowledge and expert knowledge Half-truths about commonsense knowledge Commonsense knowledge is language-independent The English-language bias is as pervasive in commmonsense reasoning as in other areas of AI. Impressively, versions of ConceptNet with at least 10,000 concepts exist in 83 different languages, and a few commonsense benchmarks have been translated (table 4) but most resources and benchmarks only exist in English or in a symbolic form in which the symbols are in fact English words or short phrases. Commonsense knowledge is the same for people of different cultures and of different historical periods Even if a belief has been commonsense knowledge for everyone at all times up to the present, that does not mean that that will continue in the future. Commonsense reasoning is fast and intuitive; it falls within “System 1” Processes in System 1 characteristically are executed quickly, do not require conscious thought, are not open to introspection, in at least in some cases are not controllable (one cannot decide not to interpret what one is seeing), and do not place a cognitive burden on working memory; vision is a paradigmatic example. Processes in System 2 are the reverse: slow, consciously carried out, consciously controllable, instrospectable, and taxing on working memory. System 2 processes can call on system 1 but not vice versa, since a fast process cannot use a slow subroutine. encyclopaedic and expert knowledge can also be called on in System 1 activities Commonsense knowledge can be expressed using simple language it seems plausible: basic vocabulary tends to refer to the well-known concepts and relations which are the subject of commonsense knowledge however, there is a very large exception here, which is commonsense spatial knowledge. Natural language is notoriously ill-suited to the description of characteristics of shapes and positions that are easily apprehended (bad expressivity of natural language) An untrue claim about commonsense knowledge commonsense knowledge is not logically complex However, in physical reasoning, understanding the physical characteristics could be quite complex (e.g., considering angry birds). But humans are good at playing angry birds. </p>

Contribution we demonstrate that fine-tuned models that were optimized for high performance, reside in well-defined regions in weight space, and vice versa language models that have been fine-tuned on the same dataset form a tight cluster in the same weight space and that models fine-tuned on different datasets from the same underlying task form a looser cluster. traversing around the region between the models reaches new models that perform comparably or even better than models found via fine-tuning Our findings demonstrate that a model positioned between two similar models can acquire the knowledge of both. We leverage this finding and design a method to pick a better model for efficient fine-tuning. more findings

Title: Contrastive Instruction Trajectory Learning for Vision Language Navigation Author: Xiwen Liang et. al. Publish Year: AAAI 2022 Review Date: Fri, Feb 10, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04138 Summary of paper Motivation previous works learn to navigate step-by-step following an instruction. However, these works may fail to discriminate the similarities and discrepancies across instruction-trajectory pairs and ignore the temporal continuity of sub-instructions. These problems hinder agents from learning distinctive vision-and-language representations, Contribution we propose a coarse-grained contrastive learning objective to enhance vision-and-language representations by contrasting semantics of full trajectory observations and instructions respectively; a fine-grained contrastive learning objective to perceive instructions by leveraging the temporal information of the sub-instructions. a pairwise sample-reweighting mechanism for contrastive learning to sampling bias in contrastive learning. Some key terms Limitation of current VLN model

Title: LAMMP Language Models as Probabilistic Priors for Perception and Action 2023 Author: Belinda Z. Li, Jacob Andreas et. al. Publish Year: 3 Feb 2023 Review Date: Fri, Feb 10, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02801.pdf Summary of paper Motivation Language models trained on large text corpora encode rich distributional information about real-world environments and action sequences. this information plays a crucial role Contribution we describe how to leverage language models for non-linguistic perception and control tasks Our approach casts labelling and decision-making as inference in probabilistic graphical models in which language models parameterize prior distributions over labels, decisions and parameters, making it possible to integrate uncertain observations and incomplete background knowledge in a principled way. Some key terms common-sense priors

Title: Multimodal Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models Author: Zhuosheng Zhang et. al. Publish Year: 2023 Review Date: Wed, Feb 8, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00923.pdf Summary of paper Motivation LLMs have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to infer the answer. to elicit CoT reasoning in multimodality, a possible solution is to fine-tune small language models by fusing the vision and language features to perform CoT reasoning. The key challenge is that those language models tend to generate hallucinated reasoning chains that mislead the answer inference. Contribution We propose Mutimodal-CoT that incorporates vision features in a decoupled training framework. The framework separates the rationale generation and answer inference into two stages, the model is able to generate effective rationales that contribute to answer inference. Some key terms Multimodal-CoT
