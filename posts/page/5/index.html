Title: Towards Tracing Factual Knowledge in Language Models Back to the Training Data Author: Ekin Akyurek et. al. Publish Year: EMNLP 2022 Review Date: Wed, Feb 8, 2023 url: https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.180.pdf Summary of paper Motivation LMs have been shown to memorize a great deal of factual knowledge contained in their training data. But when an LM generates an assertion, it is often difficult to determine where it learned this information and whether it is true. Contribution we propose the problem of fact tracing identifying which training examples taught an LM to generate a particular factual assertion. prior work on training data distribution (TDA) may offer effective tools for identifying such examples, known as “proponent”. We present the first quantitative benchmark to evaluate this we compare two popular families of TDA methods gradient based embedding based Some key terms Training data distribution method (TDA)

Title: What Makes Good Examples for Visual in Context Learning Author: Yuan Zhang et. al. Publish Year: 1 Feb 2023 Review Date: Mon, Feb 6, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13670.pdf Summary of paper Motivation in this paper, the main focus is on an emergent ability in large vision models, known. as in-context learning this concept has been well-known in natural language processing but has only been studied very recently for large vision models. Contribution we for the first time provide a comprehensive investigation on the impact of in-context examples in computer vision, and find that the performance is highly sensitive to the choice of in-context examples. exposing a critical issue that different in-context examples could lead to drastically different results. Our methods obtain significant improvements over random selection under various problem settings, showing the potential of using prompt retrieval in vision applications with a Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) business structure. we show that a good in-context example should be semantically similar to the query and closer in context. A model that can better balance spatial and se- mantic closedness in feature space would be more ideal for visual in-context learning. yeah, it is because the model is not that smart in a way that it can directly tell the semantic regardless of what the spatial structure looks like Some key terms existing issue of using LLM

Title: See, Think, Confirm: Interactive Prompting Between Vision and Language Models for Knowledge Based Visual Reasoning Author: Zhenfang Chen et. al. Publish Year: 12 Jan 2023 Review Date: Mon, Feb 6, 2023 url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05226.pdf Summary of paper Motivation Solving the knowledge-based visual reasoning tasks remains challenging, which requires a model to comprehensively understand image content, connect external world knowledge, and perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the questions correctly. Contribution We propose a novel framework named Interactive Prompting Visual Reasoner (IPVR) for few-shot knowledge based visual reasoning. IPVR contains three stages, see, think, and confirm. The see stage scans the image and grounds the visual concept candidates with a visual perception model. The think stage adopts a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to attend the key concepts from candidates adaptively. It then transforms them into text context for prompting with a visual captioning model and adopts the LLM to generate the answer. The confirm stage further uses the LLM to generate the supporting rational to the answer, verify the generated rationale with a cross-modality classifier and ensure that the rationale can infer the predicted output consistently.

Title: Reinforced Cross Modal Matching and Self Supervised Imitation Learning for Vision Language Navigation 2019 Author: Xin Wang et. al. Publish Year: Review Date: Wed, Jan 18, 2023 Summary of paper Motivation Visual Language Navigation (VLN) presents some unique challenges
first, reasoning over images and natural language instructions can be difficult. secondly, except for strictly following expert demonstrations, the feedback is rather coarse, since the “Success” feedback is provided only when the agent reaches a target position (sparse reward) A good “instruction following” trajectory may ended up just stop before you reaching the goal state and then receive zero rewards. existing work suffer from generalisation problem. (need to retrain the agent in new environment) Implementation agent can infer which sub-instruction to focus on and where to look at. (automatic splitting long instruction) with a matching critic that evaluates an executed path by the probability of reconstructing the original instruction from the executed path. P(original instruction | past trajectory) cycle reconstruction: we have P(target trajectory | the instruction) = 1, and we want to measure P(original instruction | past trajectory) this will enhance the interpretability as now you understand how the robot was thinking about </p>

Title: PC-PG Policy Cover Directed Exploration for Provable Policy Gradient Learning Author: Alekh Agarwal et. al. Publish Year: Review Date: Wed, Dec 28, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation The primary drawback of direct policy gradient methods is that, by being local in nature, they fail to adequately explore the environment. In contrast, while model-based approach and Q-learning directly handle exploration through the use of optimism. Contribution Policy Cover-Policy Gradient algorithm (PC-PG), a direct, model-free, policy optimisation approach which addresses exploration through the use of a learned ensemble of policies, the latter provides a policy cover over the state space. the use of a learned policy cover address exploration, and also address what is the catastrophic forgetting problem in policy gradient approaches (which use reward bonuses); the on-policy algorithm, where approximation errors due to model mispecification amplify (see [Lu et al., 2018] for discussion) Some key terms suffering from sparse reward

Title: Generalized Proximal Policy Optimisation With Sample Reuse 2021 Author: James Queeney et. al. Publish Year: 29 Oct 2021 Review Date: Wed, Dec 28, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation it is critical for data-driven reinforcement learning methods to be both stable and sample efficient. On-policy methods typically generate reliable policy improvement throughout training, while off-policy methods make more efficient use of data through sample reuse. Contribution in this work, we combine the theoretically supported stability benefits of on-policy algorithms with the sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. We develop policy improvement guarantees that are suitable for off-policy setting, and connect these bounds to the clipping mechanism used in PPO this motivate an off-policy version of the popular algorithm that we call GePPO. we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that our algorithm delivers improved performance by effectively balancing the competing goals of stability and sample efficiency Some key terms sample complexity

Title: Adaptive Reward Poisoning Attacks Against Reinforcement Learning Author: Xuezhou Zhang et. al. Publish Year: 22 Jun, 2020 Review Date: Tue, Dec 27, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation Non-adaptive attacks have been the focus of prior works. However, we show that under mild conditions, adaptive attacks can achieve the nefarious policy in steps polynomial in state-space size $|S|$ whereas non-adaptive attacks require exponential steps. Contribution we provide a lower threshold below which reward-poisoning attack is infeasible and RL is certified to be safe. similar to this paper, it shows that reward attack has its limit we provide a corresponding upper threshold above which the attack is feasible. we characterise conditions under which such attacks are guaranteed to fail (thus RL is safe), and vice versa in the case where attack is feasible, we provide upper bounds on the attack cost in the processing of achieving bad poliy we show that effective attacks can be found empirically using deep RL techniques. Some key terms feasible attack category
