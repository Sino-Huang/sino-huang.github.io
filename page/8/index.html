Title: On the Theory of Policy Gradient Methods Optimality Approximation and Distribution Shift 2020 Author: Alekh Agarwal et. al. Publish Year: 14 Oct 2020 Review Date: Wed, Dec 28, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation little is known about even their most basic theoretical convergence properties, including: if and how fast they converge to a globally optimal solution and how they cope with approximation error due to using a restricted class of parametric policies. Contribution One central contribution of this work is in providing approximation guarantees that are average case - which avoid explicit worst-case dependencies on the size of state space – by making a formal connection to supervised learning under distribution shift. This characterisation shows an important between estimation error, approximation error and exploration (as characterised through a precisely defined condition number) Some key terms basic theoretical convergence questions

Title: Generalized Proximal Policy Optimisation With Sample Reuse 2021 Author: James Queeney et. al. Publish Year: 29 Oct 2021 Review Date: Wed, Dec 28, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation it is critical for data-driven reinforcement learning methods to be both stable and sample efficient. On-policy methods typically generate reliable policy improvement throughout training, while off-policy methods make more efficient use of data through sample reuse. Contribution in this work, we combine the theoretically supported stability benefits of on-policy algorithms with the sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. We develop policy improvement guarantees that are suitable for off-policy setting, and connect these bounds to the clipping mechanism used in PPO this motivate an off-policy version of the popular algorithm that we call GePPO. we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that our algorithm delivers improved performance by effectively balancing the competing goals of stability and sample efficiency Some key terms sample complexity

Title: BackdooRL Backdoor Attack Against Competitive Reinforcement Learning 2021 Author: Lun Wang et. al Publish Year: 12 Dec 2021 Review Date: Wed, Dec 28, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation in this paper, we propose BACKDOORL, a backdoor attack targeted at two player competitive reinforcement learning systems. first the adversary agent has to lead the victim to take a series of wrong actions instead of only one to prevent it from winning. Additionally, the adversary wants to exhibit the trigger action in as few steps as possible to avoid detection. Contribution we propose backdoorl, the first backdoor attack targeted at competitive reinforcement learning systems. The trigger is the action of another agent in the environment. We propose a unified method to design fast-failing agent for different environment We prototype BACKDOORL and evaluate it in four environments. The results validate the feasibility of backdoor attacks in competitive environment We study the possible defenses for backdoorl. The results show that fine-tuning cannot completely remove the backdoor. Some key terms backdoorl workflow

Publish Year: 22 Jun, 2020 Review Date: Tue, Dec 27, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation Non-adaptive attacks have been the focus of prior works. However, we show that under mild conditions, adaptive attacks can achieve the nefarious policy in steps polynomial in state-space size $|S|$ whereas non-adaptive attacks require exponential steps. Contribution we provide a lower threshold below which reward-poisoning attack is infeasible and RL is certified to be safe. similar to this paper, it shows that reward attack has its limit we provide a corresponding upper threshold above which the attack is feasible. we characterise conditions under which such attacks are guaranteed to fail (thus RL is safe), and vice versa in the case where attack is feasible, we provide upper bounds on the attack cost in the processing of achieving bad poliy we show that effective attacks can be found empirically using deep RL techniques.

We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks through a series of experiments. Contribution our first observation is that reward-delay attacks are extremely effective when the goal for the adversarial is simply to minimise reward. we find that some mitigation method remains insufficient to ensure robustness to attacks that delay, but preserve the order, of rewards.

For on-policy algorithms, they update the policy network based on the transitions generated by the current policy network. The critic network would make a more accurate value-prediction for the current policy network in common environments. For off-policy algorithms, they allow to update the current policy network using the transitions from old policies. Thus, the old transitions could be reutilized, as shown in Fig. 1 the points are scattered on trajectories that are generated by different policies, which improves the sample efficiency and reduces the total training steps. Question: is there a way to improve the sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms without losing their benefit. PPO solves the problem of sample efficiency by utilizing surrogate objectives to avoid the new policy changing too far from the old policy. The surrogate objective is the key feature of PPO since it both 1. regularizes the policy update and enables the 2. reuse of training data. Algorithm ...</p>

Title: On the Robustness of Safe Reinforcement Learning Under Observational Perturbations Author: Zuxin Liu et. al. Publish Year: 3 Oct 2022 Review Date: Thu, Dec 22, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation While many recent safe RL methods with deep policies can achieve outstanding constraint satisfaction in noise-free simulation environment, such a concern regarding their vulnerability under adversarial perturbation has not been studies in the safe RL setting. Contribution we are the first to formally analyze the unique vulnerability of the optimal policy in safe RL under observational corruptions. We define the state-adversarial safe RL problem and investigate its fundamental properties. We show that optimal solutions of safe RL problems are theoretically vulnerable under observational adversarial attacks we show that existing adversarial attack algorithms focusing on minimizing agent rewards do not always work, and propose two effective attack algorithms with theoretical justifications – one directly maximise the constraint violation cost, and one maximise the task reward to induce a tempting but risky policy. Surprisingly, the maximum reward attack is very strong in inducing unsafe behaviors, both in theory and practice we propose an adversarial training algorithm with the proposed attackers and show contraction properties of their Bellman operators. Extensive experiments in continuous control tasks show that our method is more robust against adversarial perturbations in terms of constraint satisfaction.

Title: Reinforcement Learning With Perturbed Rewards Author: Jingkang Wang et. al. Publish Year: 1 Feb 2020 Review Date: Fri, Dec 16, 2022 Summary of paper Motivation this paper studies RL with perturbed rewards, where a technical challenge is to revert the perturbation process so that the right policy is learned. Some experiments are used to support the algorithm (i.e., estimate the confusion matrix and revert) using existing techniques from the supervised learning (and crowdsourcing) literature. Limitation reviewers had concerns over the scope / significance of this work, mostly about how the confusion matrix is learned. If this matrix is known, correcting reward perturbation is easy, and standard RL can be applied to the corrected rewards. Specifically, the work seems to be limited in two substantial ways, both related to how confusion matrix is learned the reward function needs to be deterministic majority voting requires the number of states to be finite the significance of this work is therefore limited to finite-state problems with deterministic rewards, which is quite restricted. overall, the setting studied here, together with a thorough treatment of an (even restricted) case, could make an interesting paper that inspires future work. However, the exact problem setting is not completely clear in the paper, and the limitation of the technical contribution is somewhat unclear. Contribution The SOTA PPO algorithm is able to obtain 84.6% and 80.8% improvements on average score for five Atari games, with error rates as 10% and 30% respectively Some key terms reward function is often perturbed

Title: Language Models as Agent Models Author: Jacob Andreas Publish Year: 3 Dec 2022 Review Date: Sat, Dec 10, 2022 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01681.pdf
Summary of paper Motivation during training, LMs have access only to the text of the documents, with no direct evidence of the internal states of the human agent that produce them. (kind of hidden MDP thing) this is a fact often used to argue that LMs are incapable of modelling goal-directed aspects of human language production and comprehension. The author stated that even in today’s non-robust and error-prone models – LM infer and use representations of fine-grained communicative intensions and more abstract beliefs and goals. Despite that limited nature of their training data, they can thus serve as building blocks for systems that communicate and act intentionally. In other words, the author said that language model can be used to communicate intention of human agent, and hence it can be treated as a agent model. Contribution the author claimed that in the course of performing next-word prediction in context, current LMs sometimes infer inappropriate, partial representations of beliefs ,desires and intentions possessed by the agent that produced the context, and other agents mentioned within it. Once these representations are inferred, they are causally linked to LM prediction, and thus bear the same relation to generated text that an intentional agent’s state bears to its communicative actions. The high-level goals of this paper are twofold: first, to outline a specific sense in which idealised language models can function as models of agent belief, desires and intentions; second, to highlight a few cases in which existing models appear to approach this idealization (and describe the ways in which they still fall short) Training on text alone produces ready-made models of the map from agent states to text; these models offer a starting point for language processing systems that communicate intentionally.
